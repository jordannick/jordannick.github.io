I'm starting a thing, to compile nuggets of wisdom related to software, hardware, gaming, or whatever I feel like. I've wanted a way to organize and reference my random ideas for myself, but anyone who stumbles here could benefit too!

This is also an experiment using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and a custom domain I've sat on for years but never actually did anything with. Thanks for reading.
